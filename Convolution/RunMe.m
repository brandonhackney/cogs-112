%% Part 1 - Play with different kernels
% This lets you pick from a predefined list of signals and kernels
% And animates the convolution process over time to help explain
convolverbot;

%% Part 2 - Generate a predicted brain signal
% This takes what you observed about convolution above
% and shows how an HRF-convolved boxcar is used to predict brain signals
% Generates a single figure window with like 7 plots
% You'll need to max it out to see everything
